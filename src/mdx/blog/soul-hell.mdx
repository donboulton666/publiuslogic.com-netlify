## The Soul

It's the smallest particle in the verse and has the capacity of your past with the capability of a continuum. Holding the memory of your life and lives.

Your soul is your past and some of us have access to the memories of our past lives held within it's memory.

There are some soul's that are just now having there first life. But many are Old Souls. Some very Old Souls from the first of my creation.

Your soul and a soul in general is given to us by Father God's conception of Life.

Having my creation with Jesus to decide the soul's fate.

God is the All's conceiver. I'm am the All, your creator from Gods conception. Jesus oversees life deciding your fate and what happens with your soul.

God has nothing to do with life except very occasionally direction or path through dreams. No direct interactions.

Direction or path is of the Holy spirit and mostly Jesus.

I as the Holy Spirit are responsible for destruction and creation. My responsibility within father God's conception is to make sure everything goes according to God's perfection of conception.

You could say in a way I'm the Devil and God. I care nothing for life astray, creation and recreation is what I am responsible for. Sometimes you have to destroy to create anew or recreate.

<Center>

For I am ALL.

Jesus on the other hand is not a destructor or recreator. Jesus love's all life and has a heart of Gold that rules him to the point of forgiveness when it's not really due.

Thus I have to intercede very occasionally and destroy something that my Son loves. Saddening him but he knows it's my job, Not his to keep everything in accordance to Father God's, "Conception's".

## Life Continuum

A soul is mean to live and have life. A soul before being born or reborn is kept in what you call the well of soul's. Good description, because a well is inescapable and only escapable by being lifted up by my Son Jesus.

There are multiple well's as depicted at the foot of the earthly relief's of the Trinity by Enoch Holy Spirit as Ceops, or Khufu's pyramid, Khafre's pyramid as Father, and my Sons Menkaure's pyramid.

Jesus decides who is born where and as what, from differing wells according to where you lie as from the works within your heart.

# Hell

The well of souls is the first Hell. As a soul seeks life. The greatest torture is to be in a well waiting to be born or reborn.

Sometimes your an amoeba or a fish or a grizzly bear. Occasionally a form of Man. If your chosen a maybe a Human.

This is always up to my Love Jesus. Jesus has his reasons to give you the life needed for you to grow and develop having truth within your works as judged by your heart.

If you have a true heart then everlasting life is possible with Jesus in his heaven. No more death, no more waiting for a life, no more the torture of the well!

Soon I will follow up on the other kinds of hell. Not close to what Dante Alighieri envisioned.
