Written in the Holy Land, "Oklahoma City"!

## The Soul

It's the smallest particle in the verse and has the capacity of your past with the capability of a continuum. Holding the memory of your life and lives.

CERN would call it the God particle.

Your soul is your past and some of us have access to the memories of our past lives held within.

There are some soul's that are just now having there first life. But many are Old Souls. Some are very Old Souls from the first of my creation.

Your soul and a soul in general is given to us by Father God's conception of Life.

Held within the Book Of Life.

Having my creation with Jesus to decide the soul's fate.

<Section>

God is the All's conceiver. I'm am the All, your and the verse's creator from Gods conception. Jesus oversees life deciding your fate and what happens with your soul.

God has nothing to do with life, except occasionally directing our path through dreams. No direct interactions.

</Section>

<Section>

Direction or path is of the Holy spirit and mostly Jesus.

I as the Holy Spirit are responsible for destruction and creation. My responsibility within father God's conception is to make sure everything goes according to God's perfection of conception.

You could say in a way I'm the job of being the Devil and God, of which I'm neither, I care nothing for life astray, creation and recreation is what I am responsible for. Sometimes thru destruction.

</Section>

<Section>

> Sometimes you have to destroy to create anew or recreate.

> For "I Am, 'ALL".

Jesus on the other hand is not a destructor or re-creator. Jesus love's all life and has a heart of Gold that rules him to the point of forgiveness when it's not really due.

Thus I have to intercede very occasionally and destroy something that my Son loves. Saddening him but he knows it's my job, Not his to keep everything in accordance to Father God's, "Conception's".

## Life Continuum

</Section>

<Section>

A soul is meant to live and have life. A soul before being born or reborn is kept in what you call the well of soul's. Good description, because a well is inescapable and only escapable by being lifted up by my Son Jesus.

There are multiple well's as depicted at the foot of the earthly relief's of the Trinity by Enoch.

## Pyramid's of Giza

> Holy Spirit as Ceops, or Khufu's pyramid.
>
> > Khafre's pyramid as Father God.
>
> > > Jesus my Sons pyramid as Menkaure.

Jesus decides who is born where and as what, from differing wells according to where you lie, as from the works within your heart.

# Hell

</Section>

The devil's hell is life on earth, where it's her/his job to deceive you, test you, leading you astray, thus in death my Son Jesus choses heaven or well hell for you. This is clearly stated in the book of Job.

<Section>

The well of souls is the first Hell. As a soul seeks life. The greatest torture is to be in a well waiting to be born or reborn.

Sometimes your born as an amoeba or a fish or a grizzly bear. Occasionally a form of Man. If your chosen a maybe a Human.

> Jesus Hold's the key's to Heaven and Hell

This is always up to my Love Jesus. Jesus has his reasons to give you the life needed for you to grow and develop having truth within your works as judged by your heart.

</Section>

<Section>

If you have a true heart then everlasting life is possible with Jesus in his heaven. No more death, no more waiting for a life, no more the torture of Jesus's well hell!

Soon I will follow up on the other kinds of hell. 

Not close to what Dante Alighieri envisioned.

## Eternal Damnation

In my first biblical work [Creation of All](https://bibwoe.com/posts/creation-of-all/) I made it clear I am ALL and all is created from the fragmentation of father God, "He/Him", from Chaos to Formalized Chaos or Creation of the All.

I hold the keys to time and eternity. Thus my hell is "Eternal Damnation", of which I have never used till now.

> All of you that constantly stomp on the 10 commandments and doing what is against your heart, as knowing it, but doing it anyway. As in illegal immigration, Government lies, Religious leaders of all kinds doing works for there own benefit, along with the Elite and super rich will find yourselves in eternal damnation. 
>
> > There is not a dam thing you can do about it, but repent. 90% of the time you cannot because you have harmed many of my children. Too many times.
>
> > > You will be scattered in darkness, no companionship, no life, no light, just the comparisons  of your past lives to knowledge of father truths, where you'll scream, "burning inside" for eternity.
