I'm reevaluating my Angel. CA might not be the best place to start. Check out OKC Oklahoma, we could take over that town, real easy. It's one of the fastest growing communities in the World and has lots of money new and old. The tallest building in the USA west is in OKC and they are building one of the tallest and biggest building's in the World.

See what ya think. I could afford 80% the rent in a 3 bedroom apt for You and Rena and your friend. we could change the world from OKC. Californians are lost and not much helping the lies they tell themselves. Good people in there hearts but lost in there minds. Really lost "wacko's".

I love You please respond. Not in a song. Tell me something.
