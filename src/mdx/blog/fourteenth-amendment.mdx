## How Law

Our governments have forgotten that our laws are hopefully determined by intent and timeliness.

We make and determine our laws according to whats going on at that time.

We would have no use in have a cyber security law in 1863, as so, "our laws are timely".

## In my life

</Section>

<Section>

Our laws are founded and based through some kind of idealistic premise. 

Not considerations through Socratic philosophy, nor whether it's really good for mankind or our the country. Usually not according to Gods laws.

## Purpose a Better Union

After the civil war there seemed to be little time for debate and in haste the 14th Amendment. It's intent was to give freedom and equal rights to the slaves.

Based on what was going on at that time. It's application is more determinate to a time than any other Amendment to our Constitution. With it's only intent directed at freeing the slaves.

Not even statutes of criminality based on the determined intent of it's writing's.

Like our Bill of Rights and the Declaration of Independence basically was to be for all.

It's clear our founding fathers intent was to give equal rights to elite white folks not the Indians or Women or Black people, the Irish and many others. These groups rights were determined later; Or? Was Thomas Jefferson's intent.

According to Mr. Thomas Jefferson, it is a self-evident truth or, if you prefer: a “sacred and undeniable truth “that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.

It was never intended for everyone to be equal.

Our bill of rights is clear that it's just a bunch of words on paper. There is no criminality behind them to enforce these supposed basic rights. 

Anyone can violate your rights and what ya going to do about it. If ya a rich person you sue with a very larger retainer for an attorney. 

The state or federal Government is not going to help enforce your so called unalienable rights.

That pretty much leaves 90% having to just deal with it, as we cannot afford an attorney.

Good luck with the Federal courts to let you go, "in propria persona, 'Your own lawyer". Or state, "in forma pauperis, 'You can't afford a lawyer or court filings", unless your incarcerated.

So screw the Bill or Rights and the Declaration of Independence. Just lies as they do not enforce what they write about what we were supposedly given.

So the intent of the Declaration of Independence and our Bill of right's are a guise and a ploy to deceive and trick you into thinking you have something.

Same with the 14th Amendment, not well written, nor well thought out! Naturalization is not a given premise as it was there intent to keep it vague.

> A lot of our laws since are intended to be vague.

Donald trump need's to either get rid of congress and let the people represent themselves, "Elon"! Or have congress determine true intent in law making. Adding criminal statutes for the enforcement to our right's.

## Fourteenth Amendment Flaws

</Section>

<Callout>

Following the Civil War, Congress submitted to the states three amendments as part of its Reconstruction program to guarantee equal civil and legal rights to Black citizens. A major provision of the 14th Amendment was to grant citizenship to “All persons born or naturalized in the United States,” thereby granting citizenship to formerly enslaved people.

Another equally important provision was the statement that “nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.” The right to due process of law and equal protection of the law now applied to both the federal and state governments.

On June 16, 1866, the House Joint Resolution proposing the 14th Amendment to the Constitution was submitted to the states. On July 28, 1868, the 14th amendment was declared, in a certificate of the Secretary of State, ratified by the necessary 28 of the 37 States, and became part of the supreme law of the land.

Congressman John A. Bingham of Ohio, the primary author of the first section of the 14th Amendment, intended that the amendment also nationalize the Bill of Rights by making it binding upon the states. When introducing the amendment, Senator Jacob Howard of Michigan specifically stated that the privileges and immunities clause would extend to the states “the personal rights guaranteed and secured by the first eight amendments.” Historians disagree on how widely Bingham's and Howard's views were shared at the time in the Congress, or across the country in general. No one in Congress explicitly contradicted their view of the amendment, but only a few members said anything at all about its meaning on this issue. For many years, the Supreme Court ruled that the amendment did not extend the Bill of Rights to the states.

Not only did the 14th Amendment fail to extend the Bill of Rights to the states; it also failed to protect the rights of Black citizens. 

A legacy of Reconstruction was the determined struggle of Black and White citizens to make the promise of the 14th Amendment a reality. 

Citizens petitioned and initiated court cases, Congress enacted legislation, and the executive branch attempted to enforce measures that would guard all citizens’ rights. 

While these citizens did not succeed in empowering the 14th Amendment during Reconstruction, they effectively articulated arguments and offered dissenting opinions that would be the basis for change in the 20th century.

## Birthright Citizens

</Section>

<CalloutDanger>

The 14th amendment is clear, this law was about the Slaves. Not future generations or invaders. Jurisdiction is determined by citizenship or the country from which the citizen declares allegiance to. 

A country where someone is not present at the time.

Since the USA did not have jurisdictional allegiance determined by the immigrant in question. Then there child is a citizen of the country from which allegiance is determined by their own, "the immigrant", declarations of origin.

## Most Immigrants

Make it clear that our laws do not apply to them.

1. Breaking into our country is a perfect example.

2. Los Angeles ICE protests are another example. 

They state that they are Mexicans. Burning American flags! 

Thus by statement and definition they are under the jurisdiction and authority of the Mexican Gov and Nation.

So they cannot be and are not naturalized.

<Section>

All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. 

No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.
