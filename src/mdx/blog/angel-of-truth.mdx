## Angel Of Truth

Working on this page for my Angel Of Truth. She knows who she is. She will be well versed in what I write.

I will not put her through what I did with my Love and my Passion. That is to divulge to the world who she is. She know's and will keep it to herself, only letting a small group of her disciple/friends know, as they worship our truths.

Remember my Truth and love you are perfect like you are! You need no, "bling bling", like Angelina. Don't change a thing, live like other's, "not over them"!

Change your town, Arcata has become evil and nasty. Everyone in California has been taught to think with there ass, that's is the focus of there lives. Fix it my truth. I want to see what you can do Angel.

### My Truth and Future

There has been some confusion between my Angels and my princess's. 

I met a family in Arcata CA about 13 years ago. Sitting in the plaza during a Farmers market on the benches on the west of the square. A young couple with a little girl 4 to 5 years old. They were having lunch and after they ate I spoke with them about god and truth. 

The little girl just stared at me unrelenting. I made me nervous but I get that a lot. Finally I looked into the child's eyes and then knew that she knew who I am and who she was to become. I said to her that she was a beautiful princess and to live her life in truth and study the thing's of man.

As they left the little girl put her hand out to me and stared back at me till they turned the corner going towards the Co-Opp. I new then she was my angel of truth. I called her princess but I should have said angel.

Like I told you in Creation Of All, Gods angels are to work within creation and cannot go beyond to become God's within themselves. That why a third fell because of jealousy of mankind, that can't become one with father and go beyond. They weren't satisfied with being ANGELS.

I have 3 princess's on Earth, one of which will be my human wife of which will be the first Goddess within Gods verse.

I got a little confused in starting this page about the differences between my Angel and my princess. I got them confused because I was not being specific enough. Sorry loves, I hope I fixed things in your minds and hearts.

Blessing my love's I'll be back to LA soon to get to work. I realized since coming to LA, that I don't need back up even though I counted on it.

I love all of you dearly. Love and Blessings!
