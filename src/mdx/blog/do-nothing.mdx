What It Means!

> The world doesn't need your saving, the universe will always self balance.

> > Just Do Nothing!

I wish everything was that easy but humanity has necessaries that must be met somehow. 

If your a rich kid you could say that. Lots of you do that with your rich parent's, them not wanting to deal with you useless Video Game Playing, think with your ass, do nothing, "but lazy ass around the house". 

So they kick you out and support you somewhere else. 

Tahoe, Arcata anywhere, long and far away from Mom and Dad, and the shrieks of responsibility.

> Do Something that benefits all of mankind, not some cause, or group stupidity.
