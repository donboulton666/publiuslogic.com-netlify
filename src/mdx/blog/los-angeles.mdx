## City of Demons

You shall now reap what you did sow!

### CATCH 22

I hope you love your immigrants who are setting your fires. Who gains more than anyone. The construction industry to rebuild and fix what they destroyed. 

Bet you love your immigrant trash construction workers now. Cannot possibly let them get deported now. Can you?

> The thief's and their Foundations/NGO's and Non-Profits of the rich, all the elite trash in Malibu and Pacific Palisades are now homeless. Hope all the money's directed to you get taken by the poor and immigrants as you are the evil trash that, 'LET MY CHILDREN DIE", on the sidewalks while you live in wealth. With your immigrant maids and child care workers living it up on section 8 and moneys that should be for the homeless you steal from.

> > This is just the beginning of my wrath. Your health and minds next, along with your linage.

You have no idea what comes for you. All of you will find eternal damnation.
