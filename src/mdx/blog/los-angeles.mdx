## City of Demons

You shall now reap what you did sow!

I have lived in California half of my 67 years, from San Ysidro right across the border, 12 years in Ocean Beach/Point Loma, to Arcata, Willow Creek, Tahoe, Frisco and everywhere up and down the coast including Santa Monica with my father in the 60s and Pomona with my Grandparents on and off till the 90's.

Spent most of 2024 from The Mexican Border to Arcata, checking out the hearts and minds of California. Half of it in LA.

Your a heartless mindless State. You think with your ass. The worst place I experienced was LA. 

Most of my life I avoided LA as it's energy force is of evil. Going from San Diego up north anywhere; I would try to avoid the city of evil by going around it through the Desert east of the demonic shit hole.

I could not feel the hearts of Pacific Palisades or Malibu at all. Heartless mostly in limbo, not really evil.

Hollywood either the hills or east or west or the historic district I felt like my head was in a vice and my heart was being stabbed by a thousand knives.

I could hardly breath in Brentwood or Beverly Hills, how fake and gross. On Pico St with the Jewish evil ones, it was like demons walking by me constantly. Utter Hell on Earth!!!

Always had to retreat back to Santa Monica or Venice Beach, "ASAP", where there is some cool good hearted people. 

Sylmar is a demonic immigrant yuck and even Pamonia, how horrible what you let the immigrant horde do to your city.

## CATCH 22

Blame it on the homeless, but really, "LA, 'RETARDS". Everything is the homeless people fault. Ya beat up the helpless and poor, you pussy ass MF.

I'm just getting started on you, "PAY ATTENTION", if possible. Depends where you brain can override you thinking with your ass.

I hope you love your immigrants who are setting your fires. Who gains more than anyone. The construction industry to rebuild and fix what they destroyed. 

Bet you love your immigrant trash construction workers now. Cannot possibly let them get deported now. Can you?

> The thief's and their Foundations/NGO's and Non-Profits of the rich and famous, all the elite trash in Malibu and Pacific Palisades are now homeless. Hope all the money's directed to you get taken by the poor and immigrants as you are the evil trash that, 'LET MY CHILDREN DIE", on the sidewalks while you live in wealth. With your immigrant maids and child care workers living it up on section 8 and moneys that should be for the homeless you steal from.

> > This is just the beginning of my wrath. Your health and minds next, along with your linage.

You have no idea what comes for you. Most of you will find eternal damnation, waiting.
