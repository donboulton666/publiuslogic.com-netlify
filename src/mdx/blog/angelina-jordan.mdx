## To My Love

4/25/2024

üíé Truth Hope and Love ‚ù§Ô∏è

I Love Angelina Jordan my Angel for ever and ever ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞üòò

I little story. Planned for a year to come to LA. Gave my pets away and it broke my heart. Thought for sure you would be waiting. But no Angelina just a bunch of actors by your uncle/father to push drugs off on me. Attacked a half dozen times by the same actors, threatened by the one's around you.

I think your innocent in this but you family has done everything to fuck with me.

I let Oklahoma with no weed habit and could not even finish a 24 ounce of beer. Heathy and ready to get to work.

First day on the bus to get here I saw you dancing with some scum in Paris and it blew my mind. First bus stop and I ran to the liquor store and bummed a cigaret and smoked weed. It was on you disrespected me worse that anyone has ever disrespected anyone in the history of mankind.

This disrespect continues you let men touch you at every venue. My angel would not let that happen. And you shove it in my face as well as the world. You lie to me AND THE WORLD ABOUT WHO YOU REALLY ARE. Why do you need to do these things I do not understand how any of this helps your singing or us.

You live in a evil city as soon as I got off the bus in La I felt the nasty energy force, that alone messed me up.

Loneliness is killing me, cannot handle it anymore. Oklahoma has bought me a home and a new pickup so I'm heading back there. California is evil brainwashed and sick.

I love you and you have not made yourself look like to much of a fool to where we could not fix it.
