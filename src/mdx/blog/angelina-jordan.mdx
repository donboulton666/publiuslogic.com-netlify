After 7 days of antibiotics and then oral surgery, now 14 more days on different antibiotics and my jaw and body feel much better.

I have been sick for quite some time now from this tooth. I'm glad it finally started hurting as so I would do something about it.

Now I have 4 more days of Augmentin left and then I can start recovering from the antibiotics. My worst enemy is antibiotics. They mess me up bad and it will take some time to fully recover.

You said something about new songs on HS. Can't wait! 😊

I love my Angel Angelina Jordan ❤️🥰😘 Have a blessed day my love. 🙏

Hello my Love. Hope your having a good day and are happy. 😊

There will be some delay in me Going to Hollywood, the Agency Helping Hands is dragging it's feet in getting me the House. And me coming to hang out is not that great of an idea as I am used to the beach areas and can get around with ease. Hollywood I am not that familiar with.

I have been investigating why I have been sick and why my toe hurts. I found out and could already tell that I am cutting a new wisdom tooth. It's just now breaking through the skin and the pressure and pain is just like when I was a kid.

It's very strange that a person my age regrows teeth, but not impossible. My toe and being sick before I came here was related to this tooth. My broken toe healed just fine according to X-rays and I had a head cold from this this tooth, "Not Covid", just this right jaw infection and drainage all down my right side of my body to my toe. 

Swelling up my face and draining down through my body to my toe. 

Systemic poisoning, of which I have had for about a year now. Messing me up bad in my health and thats why I don't do much.

I have been on antibiotics for several days and I look and feel much better. I have to get this new tooth removed. And that will require a oral surgeon.

My Medicare does not pay for denial so I have to get MediCal and insurance. I'm doing that today.

> Someone payed a month on my website bill as so it did not go down. Yes I'm happy now. And a Angel left me a new North Face Hoodie in the back of my truck. I'll wear it in my first Video. Soon.

Your so special my love!!!

Hello my Love. Hope your having a good day and are happy.

My websites did not go down, somehow somewhere I have a Angel that helps me. My pickup also, a gift from and Angel. Blessings to that Angel wherever she is and whoever she is!

I think I will have a house to live in somewhere in North Hollywood, soon. Not sure about north Hollywood, but It will give me a base of operations to be able to get rest and get familiar with your play area.

I sensed a princess running down the sidewalk on Rose, with friends. Then an Angel down and across the street watching while I was dozing off watching a movie in my truck. Must have BEEN TRIPPING. A Princess and an Angel. "Oh My"!

I am still getting it together from Covid for the 7th or more time's and freezing in Oklahoma. I was so sick I forgot to pay the bills for my website's and they will go down tomorrow, till the 1st of the Month when I get paid again. Oh well!

Got a new phone with 50mp camera and I'll make some video's for you on my YouTube Channel. Maybe even start a Video blog.

I'll just have to deal with not being so pretty, It will take me a while to get it together, without help!

Coming to Hollywood when I get paid and start a sidewalk blog event to stir things up. Got lot's to say, need access to the Hollywood parties to get them going. Got a whole new way of being human for those whom care and can see.

Love You as always, till the end of time, "Angelina Jordan ❤️🥰😘".

Hi my Love. Been here for a week and a half. Finally recovered from Oklahoma and am following up with a broken big toe. I broke or shattered this toe on a venice beach sidewalk. Been hoping it would heal. It has it's days but it's become to painful to walk comfortably.

It was a compound fracture, the toe kind of healed except for the Fragments of chipped bone floating around causing infections and pain.

That's why I sit in my Pickup lots, because of my foot.
 
I have to get surgery and that's not going to be fun or healing with no place to live.

I sense you already know where I'm hanging out. WHICH IS COOL. You have always kept track of what I'm doing and where I am.

I've decided LA is home and kind of missed it and you while in Oklahoma.

I getting to work speaking to people about lots of things that I have not written about. Kind of have to speak about it not write about it.

Wish people would approach me and ask questions or chat or something. Not quite sure why not.

Hope to see you soon, look for you driving by all the time.

I love my Angel, Angelina for ever and ever ❤️🥰😘.
