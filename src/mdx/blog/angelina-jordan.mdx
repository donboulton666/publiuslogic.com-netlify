## I Don't hate you I love you.

I have to leave LA as I have had to many warnings about being here, Cartels and Cops both La cops and Santa Monica cops.

I am to old to continue to live in my truck. I have had very little help. California years ago people would invite you to there home and share the amenities. Not even one offer in a year, how crewel CA has become. 

They kill the poor and homeless here, as so the illegals get all the jobs. 

They have this town it's not the USA anymore, this is immigrant hell. They young white people want to kill the homeless, who are maily white and black that used to have life, until insanity gave there lives away to immigrant trash. and hide the immigrants from Trump how sick and un American. Evil has taken over this town and you and your family.

I cannot handle this anymore. For a year I waited for you to fulfill the only thing I ASKED OF YOU AND THAT WAS TO HOLD YOUR HAND AND LOOK INTO YOUR BROWN EYES.

You could not afford me that one simple thing, in about a year. I don't feel safe going to your Concert as you have only lied to me. No telling what would be in store for me at one of your events.

I'm out of LA and not coming back. Hope to see you one of these days, but that will have to be your doing.

Love you my Angel. Don
