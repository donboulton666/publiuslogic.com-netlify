## I Don't hate you I love you.

I have to leave LA as I have had to many warnings about being here, Cartels and Cops both La cops and Santa Monica cops.

I am to old to continue to live in my truck. I have had very little help. California years ago people would invite you to there home and share the amenities. Not even one offer in a year, how cruel and mean CA has become. 

> They kill the poor and homeless here, as so the illegals get all the jobs. 
>
> > They have this town it's not the USA anymore, this is immigrant hell. The young white people want to kill the homeless, who are mainly white and black that used to have a life, jobs cats and dogs; "until immigrant insanity gave there lives away to the immigrant trash. In Venice Beach they have community meanings on how to hide the immigrants from Trump, how sick and un American. 

> Evil has completely taken over this town and you and your family.

I cannot handle this anymore. For a year I waited for you to fulfill the only thing I ASKED OF YOU AND THAT WAS TO HOLD YOUR HAND AND LOOK INTO YOUR BROWN EYES.

You could not afford me that one simple thing, in about a year. 

After being poisoned several times by your mothers doing's, I don't feel safe going to your Concert as you have only lied to me and tried to intentionally hurt me. No telling what would be in store for me at one of your events.

I'm out of LA and not coming back. Hope to see you one of these days, but that will have to be your doing.

Love you my Fallen Angel. Don
