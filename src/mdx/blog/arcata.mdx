## Arcata CA

Came back to Arcata in March of 2024. Lots of changes since 2001 when there still was a counter culture. A counter culture of Hippies VW Busses, Converted School buses, hippy girls selling pot brownies out of there skirts.

Arcata ran all the hippies out and California legalized weed = no more counter culture. ðŸ˜©

But still the coolest place I've been. ðŸ˜Ž

I'll try to write a little a day for you that follow.

## Gaza Protest

Joined the Students at Cal Poly to protest Gaza, having a blast. Got everything needed but showers and shoes.

Even though this is a first. "Beat the Cops back", its not really what should occur.

I would like the kids to remember that vandalism and violence leads to more hatred. 

Is that not the foundation of what we are fighting against???

1.
But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which 
leads into the palace of justice. In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty 
of wrongful deeds. Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of 
bitterness and hatred.

2.
We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline. We must not 
allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence. Again and again we must rise to 
the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force. The marvelous new militancy 
which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for 
many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that 
their destiny is tied up with our destiny. They have come to realize that their freedom is 
inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone.

Hello Arcata, "HELP", I having issues with logistics and homelessness. Anyone got a room for rent can afford $500.00 more or less on the first of every month. I can't do the hills at my age so somewhere I could get to close to downtown or the University.

Or a place to stash my gear for the day and be able to access at night. 

That way the burden's I have wil be lesser. Instead of struggling with homelessness I could get busy and do what I came for. The world needs me and Arcata to get busy.

A back yard or storage of any place to put some things in a safe place.

4-20 in the park was not good for me, I spoke to several people about the future but not what I had planned. I hoped i would get invited into someone's circle but no one said anything. I'm old school and do not like people joining my party uninvited, I was not going to sit down uninvited. Walked by several circles, inviting eyes but no words. 

At 66 and sometimes my health gets me down and I am burdened by being homeless and having a lot of gear. 

I'ts really hard to be homeless, especially in California, where you guys make it a tough as possible for the homeless and poor. 

I'm really upset at the lack of services for the homeless in Arcata and California. 

Basically you beat down the homeless and give all the homeless moneys to illegal aliens. That's what is happening all our moneys are going toward taking care of people that obviously can't take care of there own business in there own country. Traitors to there own kind, everyone treats them like poor babes that need there ass wiped.

California your liberal stupidity is destroying your kids future, and either you don't care or you stuck on stupid.

## Beat Back the Cops

<YouTube youTubeId="h3mj5_TNfrc" />

For the last several days I've been a Cal Poly humboldt at the Gaza protest, holding down the main entrance front left flank.

Lota love here and some hate. Fragmentation of my children is kind of freaking me out. 

Everyone has classed or grouped themselves into idealistic groups that seem to have some cohesion among them.

Fragmentation of us all is the GOV game plan. 

Put us into differing groups which is division not cohesion. Then you have various truths all based upon idealistic hallucinations.

Our schools intentionally group us. But* we are all individuals in our creation, we were not born a group.

Spoke to son Faculty about this and they agreed with there eyes not verbally so they know they are guilty.

Analyzing will get back to ya?????????

Early last Month at the saturday farmers market a young lady wanted to play her guitar and sing for me. I somewhat denied her and I am sorry for that.

I'm trying getting over one of my Angels breaking my heart and shattering my mind. I fell scattered and somewhat lost.

I knew her song would help fix me and I denied her, I wanted to continue my heartbreak. 

I had also seen her in my dreams and in visions and then she was there. Just like father God had shown me, a vision of a Angel even though I never could quite make out your face, nor did I really look at you when we were talking. I have no idea who you are or what you look like but I sure wish you would now play your song for me, I really need to hear it. Father God would have not given me the visions and dreams if I did not need your truths. 

Please sing and play for me if you can forgive me for denying you the first time.
