## Arcata CA

Came back to Arcata in March of 2024. Lots of changes since 2001 when there still was a counter culture. A counter culture of Hippies VW Busses, Converted School buses, hippy girls selling pot brownies out of there skirts.

Arcata ran all the hippies out and California legalized weed = so no more counter culture.

But still the coolest place I've been.

On 4-20 I will speak to mankind at Redwood park about truth and Father Gods love.

I'll write a little a day for you that follow.
