## Arcata CA

Came back to Arcata in March of 2024. Lots of changes since 2001 when there still was a counter culture. A counter culture of Hippies VW Busses, Converted School buses, hippy girls selling pot brownies out of there skirts.

Arcata ran all the hippies out and California legalized weed = so no more counter culture.

But still the coolest place I've been.

On 4-20 I will speak to mankind at Redwood park about truth and Father Gods love.

I'll write a little a day for you that follow.

Early last Month at the saturday farmers market a young lady wanted to play her guitar and sing for me. I somewhat denied her and I am sorry for that.

I'm trying getting over one of my Angels breaking my heart and shattering my mind. I fell scattered and somewhat lost.

I knew her song would help fix me and I denied her, I wanted to continue my heartbreak. 

I had also seen her in my dreams and in visions and then she was there. Just like father God had shown me, a vision of a Angel even though I never could quite make out your face, nor did I really look at you when we were talking. I have no idea who you are or what you look like but I sure wish you would now play your song for me, I really need to hear it. Father God would have not given me the visions and dreams if I did not need your truths. 

Please sing and play for me if you can forgive me for denying you the first time.
