## Groups are of the Devil

Human grouping and its controls. Put people in groups, it drives division to control.

One thing all of you forget is that your born as one child under Father God. 

As you shall die, One Child under God.

Each individual within Father Gods Creation, with the ability to formulate self by your own means!

When you stand before Me, Jesus or maybe before Father God you are judged according to your works, within your heart.

This is the foundation of all sentient life within the verse. 

Individuality is your second greatest test. The first being who can overcome the curse of more. For as fleshly beings you constantly have to have more. Whom can sustain there individuality with less is a constant test.

Most of you cannot get enough and more, More, MORE is you course, and to do this you have to group up within your clicks and religions and countries with artificial borders and historically perfected lies. This fails Gods fist and second tests of your individuality. Fathers first question to you as you stand before him is, "Who are you"!

God knows exactly whom you are. But do you???

All most all of you would formulate your answer according to what you have learned from others or your GROUP, click, school or religion. For you know not you! Then you fail.

Individuality is the key to self and being one with the Holy Spirits truth's and having love for self and Jesus's all in your heart.

Your works are judged simply. Father does not judge you on how well you take care of your fleshly self but how you help other's within there needs of the flesh lifting up there spirit and showing love from your heart to others hearts.

A simple test of this if you dare. Is go around a randomly tell someone you love them while looking them in the eyes and projecting love from your heart. Or to everyone!

## Control Groups

Obviously your three major control groups are...

> Government
>
> > It stands on it's face if you live on planet earth you facing forced Government. Like it or Not!
>
> > > Tell them your just a individual child under gods creation, you refuse to be governed by others. See how that works? They will force you.

> Religion
>
> > Christian religion is comprised of books from people that did not know each other, exceptions being Jesus's disciples and follower's. Where is Enoch or Mary's books. Along with many other works written after Jesus's time.
>
> > > Many codex's were made of various forms by the formalized churches. and written for the churches worth, not the people's worth. The Catholic church say's that you can confess to one of there BPG and you will be forgiven; "No matter your sin"! Kick down some cash orn gold something for you Beggar Preacher God and you will be forgiven. Bypassing Jesus. How utterly stupid which is it. This is unforgivable and a sin. along with the church's hierarchy. They are saying they are the only ones with a connection to father and worship and, "pray to Us".

The church determined what is in your Bible not God. And done so to make them rich and to be able to get around mankind's laws as well as Gods.

This is a control system developed by the devil to fragment my children. And compiled with little truth; "If Any".

These individual books of the bible were written by men, no more worthy or holy than you or your children.

Our connection with Father God is individual. You are born an individual and you will stand before Father God as a individual; "NOT A GROUP".

This grouping is a fragmentation by the devil to pit you against each other. And you have fallen for this evil for two thousand years.

All three of the middle eastern religions were to control the populace and to cause separation, which is not of Father God but by the Devil.

Written by peoples whom claim to be the only one's to have a connection with father God, Jesus or the Holy Spirit. Total BS!

And stated as such that no one can add or take away fo there evil control systems. Meaning they are the only special ones.

The Jews go so far as to say they are Gods chosen and not one know God but them. Totally a lie adn locks you into hate of others. Jews have more hate for others that anyone on the planet. Is it not evident in Israel now. They hate Islam and Christianity or anyone not Jewish. Pay Attention!

Islam states that God himself wrote the Koran just for them. Everyone not like them are Infidels and should be killed.

All three of these religion are to have power over you and to fragment My children. The devil has gotten so specialized with this now your Marginalized, indigenous, different, Gay, trans or just stupid to being evil is what is with, "DEI", in full effect, your different and should be held up above others and their rights. Devilish lies...

Your all created different with different capabilities and path's. No one is equal, discrimination is of truth. Someone born with no arms cannot be a roofer, or warrior. 

Discrimination to the point of choice, not of separation.

God is All and all is of God, thus his name is, "ALL". You end your prayers with Amen, nope wrong, it should end for, "ALL MEN".

My church of, "ALL", will correct this so each can find his own path with his own way of seeing Gods truth as was intended within you creation. Each with a different face of father equal in his love but different in you path's and abilities. We should seek that diversity. The devil hate you just the same. Making you all the same is; "Her the Devil", doing.

More to come, SOON my Loves!
