## Groups are of the Devil

Human grouping and its controls. Put people in groups, it drives division to control.

One thing all of you forget is that your born as one child under Father God. 

As you shall die, One Child under God.

Each individual within Father Gods Creation, with the ability to formulate self by your own means!

When you stand before Me, Jesus or maybe before Father God you are judged according to your works, within your heart.

This is the foundation of all sentient life within the verse. 

Individuality is your second greatest test. The first being who can overcome the curse of more. For as fleshly beings you constantly have to have more. Whom can sustain there individuality with less is a constant test.

Most of you cannot get enough and more, More, MORE is you course, and to do this you have to group up within your clicks and religions and countries with artificial borders and historically perfected lies. This fails Gods fist and second tests of your individuality. Fathers first question to you as you stand before him is, "Who are you"!

God knows exactly whom you are. But do you???

All most all of you would formulate your answer according to what you have learned from others or your GROUP, click, school or religion. For you know not you! Then you fail.

Individuality is the key to self and being one with the Holy Spirits truth's and having love for self and Jesus's all in your heart.

Your works are judged simply. Father does not judge you on how well you take care of your fleshly self but how you help other's within there needs of the flesh lifting up there spirit and showing love from your heart to others hearts.

A simple test of this if you dare. Is go around a randomly tell someone you love them while looking them in the eyes and projecting love from your heart. Or to everyone!

## Control Groups

Obviously your three major control groups are...

> Government
>
> > It stands on it's face if you live on planet earth you facing forced Government. Like it or Not!
>
> > > Tell them your just a individual child under gods creation, you refuse to be governed by others. See how that works? They will force you.

> Religion
>
> > working on this
